# CSS Scroll Snap Effect

I've realized a scroll snapping effect :boom: using the ``` scroll-snap-type``` property on the container and the ``` scroll-snap-align``` property on elements inside it.
I've used JavaScript classes to manage the snapping content.

Take a look here, a wonderful article by Max Kohler:
[Practical CSS Scroll Snapping](https://css-tricks.com/practical-css-scroll-snapping/).

Hope it can help!:relieved::green_heart:
